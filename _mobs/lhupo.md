Lhupo is a shaman to Maglubiyet, carrying a small battleaxe and a crude onyx statuette of the god.

The statuette looks like a grotesque, well muscled goblin and although worth 12gp may be hard to sell.

## Reactions

As a reaction to a goblin ally being killed Lhupo can cast a Healing word that heals 1d4+1 HP to the goblin.  Recharges on a 5-6 at the start of his round.
