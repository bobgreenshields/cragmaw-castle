    An overgrown path leads to a passage that climbs up steps to a locked iron door.  Arrow slits at 10 ft high overlook the path.

- title: "Locked door"
  desc: |-
    The iron door is locked, it can be opened with thieves tools DC 15 or knocked down with a DC 25 Str check but this will make plenty of noise and alert the goblins in area 7.

- title: "Arrow slits"
  desc: |-
    Any character who pauses and listens at the arrow slits hears an occasional clatter of crockery and goblin cursing from area 7.  The goblins are not keeping watch but will raise the alarm on any noise.
