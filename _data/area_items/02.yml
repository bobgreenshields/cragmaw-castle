  desc: |-
    Goblin voices can be heard beyond the south door.  They are complaining and moaning about Lhurusk and how the hobgoblins rule over the poor goblins when it is really Grol that is king.  If the additional voices are heard faint clinking sounds from the pots and pans will also be heard.
