- title: "North wall hidden entrance"
  desc: |-
    Near the east corner of the north side a wall has partially collapsed leaving a large pile of rubble.  The collapse has breached the wall near the top but the goblins have covered the small hole (large enough for a medium sized creature) with a painted canvas that effectively camouflages the opening amongst the large displaced stones.

- title: "Overgrown postern gate"
  desc: |-
    In the middle of the south wall is a flight of steps up to a short passage that leads to a postern gate.  This area of the castle is heavily overgrown and the passage is obscured by the scrub.
